## Story

After a stressful day at work, the anxiety is getting unbearable. Finally the clock strikes 5 p.m. and you are free to go !  
Well, you still have to navigate the open space while evading your damn coworkers that will grabb you to tell you about there "who cares" lifes.  
Plus, if the anxiety gets too strong, you will go back to your desk to take a break... and then try again to reach the exit.

## Controls

Navigate through the world with the `arrows`, and use the `space bar` to enter your "bubble", your own little world were anxiety is nonexistent, and
coworkers cannot bother you ! One little problem though : inside your bubble you're unaware of the surrounding, and can't see the obstacles unless
you bump into them, making it diffcult to navigate the area...
